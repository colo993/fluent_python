# Fluent_Python
Examples from the book "Fluent Python" 2nd edition released in APril 2022 written by Luciano Ramalho.

I read the book once already but without actively coding alongside with it. I found this approach not as effective as I expected.
That's why I have decided to change approach and rewrite code from the book to practice and get deeper insight into the Python code.

Feel free to copy and experiment with the code!

The print statement is not used because I run selected parts of the code in python console.
After running a chunk of code with some class in the Python console you can test different commands, then close console without leaving any trash in your code.
